A student signed up for n workshops and wants to attend the maximum number of workshops where no two workshops overlap. You must do the following:

Implement 2 structures:

    struct Workshop having the following members:
        - The workshop's start time.
        - The workshop's duration.
        - The workshop's end time.

    struct Available_Workshops having the following members:
        - An integer, n (the number of workshops the student signed up for).
	- An array of type Workshop array having size n.

Implement 2 functions:

    1. Available_Workshops* initialize (int start_time[], int duration[], int n)
    - Creates an Available_Workshops object and initializes its elements using the elements in the start_time[] and duration[] parameters (both are of size n). 
    - Here, start_time[i] and duration[i] are the respective start time and duration for the i workshop. 
    - This function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.
    
    2. int CalculateMaxWorkshops(Available_Workshops* ptr)
    - Returns the maximum number of workshops the student can attendâ€”without overlap. 
    - The next workshop cannot be attended until the previous workshop ends.

Note: An array of unknown size (n) should be declared as follows:
	
	DataType* arrayName = new DataType[n];

Input Format

	Input from stdin is handled by the locked code in the editor; you simply need to write your functions to meet the specifications of the problem statement above.

Ouput Format

	Output to stdout is handled for you.
	Your initialize function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.
	Your CalculateMaxWorkshops function must return maximum number of non-overlapping workshops the student can attend.

Sample Input

	6
	1 3 0 5 5 8
	1 1 6 2 4 1

Sample Output

	4

Explanation

	- The first line denotes n, the number of workshops.
	- The next line contains n space-separated integers where the i integer is the i workshop's start time.
	- The next line contains n space-separated integers where the i integer is the i workshop's duration. 
	- The end_time of each i workshops should be: 2 4 6 7 9 9, respectively. The student can attend the workshop i = 0, 1, 2, 3 (at start time: 1, 3, 0, 5). So CalculateMaxWorkshops returns 4 to main (which then prints 4 to stdout).
